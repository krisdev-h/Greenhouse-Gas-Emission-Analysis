# U.S. Gas Emissions Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data
Our data is from Climate Watch's U.S. State Inventory's Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions data: https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?breakBy=countries&end_year=2020&source=US&start_year=1990

The data is collected yearly from 1990 to 2020 for each of the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia. We have four gases of interest: methane, carbon dioxide, fluorinated gases, and nitrous oxide. Our variables of interest are the emissions per state GDP, emissions per state capita, and total emissions.

## Project Description
Our analysis takes a look at each U.S. region (midwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and west) and how each of our variables affects the amount of gas emissions. Our goal is to answer the question "For each greenhouse gas, is time, GDP, or population the bigger contributor to emissions across U.S. geographical regions?"

We made bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to visually explore the relationships between gases, time, GDP, and population. We also furthered our analysis with multiple linear regression, which explored the relationships between our variables.
